# World of Weird

## üí° Inspiration

We all have heard about various wonders of the world. But some weird things are happening around the world. But we never get to know the reason behind it. So we decided to make a website where we can find out the reason behind these weird things. Along with that, we have some impractical features as well.

## üíª What it does

Our web app "World of Weird" is built with features:

- Find out the reason behind the weird things happening around the world.
- Shop for impractical things.
- Post about your impractical experience.
- A magic page for making everything OK for you.
